        <p> SCENE: The sitting-room at the_ OLLIVANTS' _in a small town
            up-State. It is an evening late in the spring.</p>
        <pre>
        OLLIVANT.  [_Affectionately._] Glad to be home again, Mary?

        MARY.      [_Evasively._] The garden is so pretty.
                   
        OLLIVANT.  Hasn't changed much, eh?
                   
        MARY.      It seems different; perhaps it's the night.
                   
        OLLIVANT.  I guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
                   mother there so often this spring.
                   
        EMILY.     [_Quietly._] This dry spell is not good for flowers.
                   
        OLLIVANT.  It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
                   thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
                   hill. [_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.] Is there any of that spray
                   mixture left, Emily, dear?
