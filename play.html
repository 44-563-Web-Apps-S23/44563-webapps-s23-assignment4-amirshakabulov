        <h4> SCENE: The sitting-room at the_ OLLIVANTS' _in a small town
            up-State. It is an evening late in the spring.</h4>

        <h5 class = "name EMILY">EMILY.</h5> <p class = "direction"> [_Quietly_]</p>
        <p class = "speech">This dry spell is not good for flowers.</p>
                   
        <h5 class = "name OLLIVANT">OLLIVANT.</h5>
        <p class = "speech">It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
            thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
            hill. 
        <p class = "direction">[_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.]</p> Is there any of that spray
            mixture left, Emily, dear? </p>
        
        <h5 class = "name EMILY">EMILY.</h5> 
        <p class = "speech">I haven't looked lately.</p>
        
        <h5 class = "name OLLIVANT">OLLIVANT.</h5>
        <p class = "speech">I'll order some to-morrow.
        <p class = "direction">[_Taking up his pipe again and
            looking for the tobacco._]</p> Think it would be a good idea, daughter, if
            you'd spray those rosebushes every couple of weeks. The bugs are a pest
            this spring. Where's my tobacco? </p>

        <h5 class = "name EMILY">EMILY.</h5> 
        <p class = "speech">On the mantel.</p>

        <h5 class = "name OLLIVANT">OLLIVANT.</h5>
        <p class = "speech">Wish you would always leave it on the table; you know how I
            hate to have things changed.</p>         
        <p class = "direction"> [OLLIVANT _goes to the mantel, filling his pipe, and while his back
            is turned_, MARY _makes a quick questioning gesture to her mother,
            who sighs helplessly_. MARY _ponders a moment_.]</p> 

        <h5 class = "name MARY">MARY.</h5>
        <p class = "speech">How's Ben been doing these two years, father?.</p> 

        <h5 class = "name OLLIVANT">OLLIVANT.</h5>
        <p class = "speech">Hasn't your brother written you?</p>   
        
        <h5 class = "name MARY">MARY.</h5>
        <p class = "speech">Only once--when I left home; he disapproved, too.</p>
